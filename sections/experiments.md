## Artificial Intelligence Generated Code Samples [![View Repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/view-repo-green)](https://github.com/danielrosehill/AI-Generated-Code-Samples)
Scripts and other programs generated with various LLMs. Sometimes they need refinement. Frequently they just work!

## Artificial Intelligence Generated Project Starters [![View Repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/view-repo-green)](https://github.com/danielrosehill/AI-Generated-Project-Starters)
AI-generated project starters for anyone wishing to carry on the ideas!

## Fun Large Language Model Data Prompts [![View Repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/view-repo-green)](https://github.com/danielrosehill/Fun-LLM-Data-Prompts)
As prompting fro data analysis & vis is quite specific, a small side collection of prompts for this purpose

## Large Language Model Evaluation Prompts [![View Repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/view-repo-green)](https://github.com/danielrosehill/LLM-Evaluation-Prompts)
A few prompts that I am storing in a repo for the purpose of running controlled experiments comparing and benchmarking different LLMs for defined use-cases

## Large Language Model Experiment Notebook [![View Repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/view-repo-green)](https://github.com/danielrosehill/LLM-Experiment-Notebook)
Experiments in evaluating various prompting strategies and LLM performance generally

## Large Language Model Long Codegen Test [![View Repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/view-repo-green)](https://github.com/danielrosehill/LLM-Long-Codegen-Test)
Experiment to evaluate the ability of code-gen LLMs to generate a long continuous (single) output

## Large Language Model Output Notes [![View Repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/view-repo-green)](https://github.com/danielrosehill/LLM-Output-Notes)
First entry documentation repository for notes mostly unedited from LLMs

## Large Language Model Outputs [![View Repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/view-repo-green)](https://github.com/danielrosehill/LLM-Outputs)
Interesting GPT outputs demonstrating specific capabilities

## Llms On Llms [![View Repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/view-repo-green)](https://github.com/danielrosehill/LLMs-on-LLMs)
Large language models (LLMs) explaining themselves - and how to make best use of them (prompt engineering). Often insightful, though accuracy not guaranteed!

## Prompt Puncutation Experiment [![View Repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/view-repo-green)](https://github.com/danielrosehill/Prompt-Puncutation-Experiment)
Experimenting to test the effect of puncutation in prompts on inference quality

## Testing Repo Public [![View Repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/view-repo-green)](https://github.com/danielrosehill/Testing-Repo-Public)
General first entry testing repository for things that need to be publicly accessible. 

## Two Ais Talk [![View Repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/view-repo-green)](https://github.com/danielrosehill/Two-AIs-Talk)
Experiment:  two AI agents, each one thinks the other is a liar...
