# Llm Repositories

## [Large Language Model Max Token Length 0225](https://github.com/danielrosehill/LLM-Max-Token-Length-0225)
A plot showing the evolution of the max output token length by major LLMs, Feb 2025

## [Large Language Model Assistants Web Library](https://github.com/danielrosehill/LLM-Assistants-Web-Library)
A web UI for open-sourcing my assistant configurations (WIP)

## [Large Language Model Long Codegen Test](https://github.com/danielrosehill/LLM-Long-Codegen-Test)
Experiment to evaluate the ability of code-gen LLMs to generate a long continuous (single) output

## [Large Language Model Api Key Manager](https://github.com/danielrosehill/LLM-API-Key-Manager)
Coming soon, a minimalist local first tool for organizing and displaying a list of API keys for large language models that can be accessed this way. 

## [Large Language Model System Prompts](https://github.com/danielrosehill/LLM-System-Prompts)
A few system prompts for LLMs intended to improve the format and utility of outputs. Written primarily for LibreChat but should be reasonably frontend-agnostic

## [Large Language Model Output Vault Parameters](https://github.com/danielrosehill/LLM-Output-Vault-Parameters)
Some parameteric data about my LLM output repository as it scales

## [Large Language Model Attribution Badges](https://github.com/danielrosehill/LLM-Attribution-Badges)
Markdown badges for attributing LLM generated (or co-generated) content (using Shields.io)

## [Large Language Model Output Notes](https://github.com/danielrosehill/LLM-Output-Notes)
First entry documentation repository for notes mostly unedited from LLMs

## [Llms On Llms](https://github.com/danielrosehill/LLMs-on-LLMs)
Large language models (LLMs) explaining themselves - and how to make best use of them (prompt engineering). Often insightful, though accuracy not guaranteed!

## [Large Language Model Experiment Notebook](https://github.com/danielrosehill/LLM-Experiment-Notebook)
Experiments in evaluating various prompting strategies and LLM performance generally

## [Large Language Model Api Price Estimates](https://github.com/danielrosehill/LLM-API-Price-Estimates)
Some cost estimates for using LLMs via API versus web UI services (like ChatGPT)

## [Large Language Model Evaluation Prompts](https://github.com/danielrosehill/LLM-Evaluation-Prompts)
A few prompts that I am storing in a repo for the purpose of running controlled experiments comparing and benchmarking different LLMs for defined use-cases

## [Large Language Model Workspace Scaffolder](https://github.com/danielrosehill/LLM-Workspace-Scaffolder)
A quick scaffolding script for populating a repository with folders for organising prompts and outputs, as commonly required when working with LLMs

## [Large Language Model Use Case Self Ideation](https://github.com/danielrosehill/LLM-Use-Case-Self-Ideation)
LLM-generated documents describing potential use-cases for GPTs & other LLMs across both professional and business contexts with sections describing potential/predicted evolutions as underlying technology advances

## [Large Language Model Outputs](https://github.com/danielrosehill/LLM-Outputs)
Interesting GPT outputs demonstrating specific capabilities
